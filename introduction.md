## What is CASE ?

CASE is a Typescript lightweight **BaaS (Backend As A Service)** requiring minimal coding.

It provides a complete backend to your client app without the hassle that comes with it.

## Main features

- ⚡ **Instant backend with DB, REST API and Admin panel** without any configuration
- 🧠 **Smart SDK** to import in your favorite JS front-end
- 🛠️ **Essential features** like Auth, Storage, Validation and Hooks

## A complete backend without leaving your IDE

**You know how to code, so go ahead and do it**. You don't need to be coddled with drag-and-drop options and visual builders.

With CASE, you can quickly add a backend to your app while **staying within your development environment**. This allows you to work in your language, maintain consistent versioning, and moreover have a coherent development experience.

## The anatomy of a CASE backend

The entire backend fits into the following folder structure:

```
.
├──── db # SQLite database
├──── dist # Compiled output
├──── entities # folder that holds custom entities
├──── node_modules
├──── public # public folder for storage and assets
├ .env
├ .gitignore
├ nodemon.json
├ README.md
├ package.json
└ ts-config.json
```
