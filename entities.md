# Create an entity

An entity is an object often linked to a real world concept like users, customers, videos etc. Creating an entity in manifest generates **CRUD endpoints** that can be used by the [REST API](rest-api.md) or the [SDK](javascript-sdk.md).

All entities are located in the `backend.yml` file under the **entities** property.

## Syntax

Let's see a simple example:

```yaml
# manifest/backend.yml
name: A pet app

entities:
  üò∫ Cat:
    properties:
      - name
  üê∂ Dog:
    properties:
      - name
```

This file will generate the **Cat** and **Dog** entity both with a `name` property. You can now add your own pets through the admin panel!

Dummy data is crucial for app development and testing. You can generate dummy data for all your entities with the simple command:

```
npm run manifest:seed
```

:::warning

The seed replaces the previous data by the new one and thus should never be used in production.

## Entity params

You can pass different arguments to configure your entities. Example:

```yaml
entities:
  üë§ Member:
    seedCount: 200
    mainProp: lastName
    properties:
      - firstName
      - lastName
      - email
```
