# Create an entity

An entity is an object often linked to a real world concept like users, customers, videos etc.

All entities are located in the `backend.yml` file under the **entities** property.

## Syntax

Let's see a simple example:

```yaml
# manifest/backend.yml
name: A pet app

entities:
  üò∫ Cat:
    properties:
      - name
  üê∂ Dog:
    properties:
      - name
```

This file will generate the **Cat** and **Dog** entity both with a `name` property. You can now add your own pets trough the admin panel !

Dummy data is crucial for app development and testing. You can generate dummy data for all your entities with the simple command:

```
npm run seed
```

:::warning

The seed replaces the previous data by the new one and thus should never be used in production.

:::

## Entity params

You can pass different arguments to configure your entities. Example:

```yaml
entities:
  üë§ Member:
    seedCount: 200
    mainProp: number
    properties:
      - name
      - number
      - email
```
